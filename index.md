## About

I am a machine learning researcher with a PhD in **computational modelling and deep learning**, working at the intersection of:

- physics-based simulation  
- scientific computing  
- neural network surrogate models  

My recent work focuses on developing **deep-learning surrogates** for **granular flow simulations**, replacing expensive Discrete Element Method (DEM) solvers with fast, data-driven models while preserving physical fidelity.

I am particularly interested in research and engineering roles involving **ML for physical systems**, **AI for engineering applications**, and **scientific computing**.
